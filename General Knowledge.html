				Sikhs are found almost everywhere around the Earth but their point of origin is Punjab, India. Many Sikhs are found in Punjab as Northern India is where the religion was founded. The holiest site of worship is located in Amritsar, Punjab, and is called "Harmandir Sahib", nicknamed The Golden Temple. Many Sikhs are also found in Canada and the U.S.A considering the fact that Punjabi is the third language of Canada. People have made small "colonies" around the world, and some are filled with Sikhs who do not follow the religion and some with people who do. For instance, the point of origin, India, has a lower chance of having a full Sikh due to the rate at which people are converting. Shocking, right? The place of origin should have many Sikhs but there are many more full Sikhs around the world.

				The Sikhs speak the Punjabi language but it is different in the Holy Book. In the Holy Book, a scripture called "Gurmukhi" was used. In other words, Punjabi is a simpler version of the Gurmukhi script. Punjabi is also spoken around many different places around the world. The Gurmukhi scripture is a very hard scripture and has many tough meanings. Almost all words in Punjabi have different counterparts in the Gurmukhi script. There are many people who don't understand the Holy Book due to the fact that they do not understand the Gurmukhi scripture. This is one of the main reasons for why people are converting and being affected by peer pressure. The Holy Book teaches many things and if people do not understand the Holy Book then the Sikh religion is of no use. This is because people will not have any reason to still remain in the Sikh religion.
