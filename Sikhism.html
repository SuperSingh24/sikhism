		<h1>
			Sikhism
		</h1>

		<p>
			Sikhism is a unique religion. It doesn't have any stories of creation or stories of the first people, instead, it is a way of life. Sikhs, the followers of Sikhism, literally meaning student, don't believe in superstition, and rituals. They believe that humans should not be simple-minded and should have logic. They also believe in equality among all, whether they are black, female, Muslim, Hindu, or Jewish, everyone is regarded as one. Sikhs also believe in service which is called "sewa". This involves the practice of giving something to either the needy or anyone in general. Sikhs go to the "Gurudwara", which is their place of worship, where free food, "langar", is served to anyone. Everyone sits on the floor to symbolize equality, whether they are rich or poor everyone is equal in the eye of God. Sikhs also believe in one God and nothing else. The Sikhs had 10 prophets, all of which spread teachings of the religion, and the fifth Sikh prophet compiled the teachings of the previous prophets. Later, the tenth prophet added the other's teachings and officially named it the "Guru Granth Sahib Ji". It is regarded as the eleventh prophet in the religion. Sikhs wear the 5 K's which symbolize the devotion of a Sikh to "Waheguru" (literally meaning great lord). They include the Kara, a type of bracelet on the arm, Kachera, a sort of undergarment, Kesh, the uncut hair, Kirpan, a small dagger, and Kanga, a small comb. In general, Sikhs should be strong mentally, have great willpower to avoid superstition, be men and women of good deeds, to not harm your own health, and remember that everyone is equal no matter their race or religion.
