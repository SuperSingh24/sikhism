		<p>
			My name is Ikjyot Singh. I really love my religion and culture, and really feel sad when someone is forced to give up their religion due to the lack of knowledge. I made this website so I could teach people about the religion of Sikhism, and about the Punjabi Culture. I witnessed so many people around me go through many problems such as peer pressure, and conversion due to the lack of knowledge about the religion. I have a friend who once started smoking due to peer pressure from his school friends. After he stopped, I asked him why, and he told me that he didn't know smoking wasn't allowed. Another person who cut his hair told me that he did it to look more handsome. It was at this moment when I was really sad and angry at the parents of these children for not teaching them well. I just made this website to build a small foundation for other kids like the ones I mentioned above so that none of this happens to anyone else, again. Another reason for me to make this website was to teach other people the difference between Sikhism and Islam. As shown in the video before, a young Sikh boy was called a terrorist just for wearing a turban. I also really felt bad for him because, as a fellow Sikh, you cannot be called a terrorist just for being a follower of Sikhism. I hope this website helped.
