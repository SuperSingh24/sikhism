	<h1>
		Religion and Culture
	</h1>

		<p>
			Religion and Culture might have similarities but they are totally different. There are many people who don't understand the difference between the both. Religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman being who has control over the universe. On the other hand, culture is defined as the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society. Culture revolves around ideas and traditions, while religion mainly revolves around a superhuman being controlling the universe. Religion and Culture have different ways of connecting people.<br>
			There are many religions around the world, but there are many more cultures in the world. There are also some religions that are said to originate from cultures and borrow ideas from them. Religions can also include people from many different cultures around the world. For example, in Sikhism, people could originate from the Punjabi culture, while others from the Gujrati culture. Sometimes it is unlikely that some culture can be a part of certain religions. It also depends on the geographical location. There is a lesser chance for people from the Gujrati culture to be Sikhs as they originate from West India, where Hinduism is a popular religion. <br>
			Moreover, religion and culture do have similarities. They both have their own practices. Some religions include rituals and prayer for god while cultures invlolve rituals and practices for different ocassions such as the transfer from childhood to manhood.
