			Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest religion, which was founded in the Punjab region of India about 500 years ago. There are about 25 million Sikhs around the world, of which most of them live in India, however, about, 500,000 make the U.S their home. Sikhism is a diverse religion, with people from all corners of the earth. No matter black or white, Sikhs dwell in a variety of locations. However, due to the unique attributes of Sikhs, they are somehow different in the various communities in the world. Many young people, ranging from the age of 12 to 20, are forced into peer pressure, westernization, and in general, illiteracy of the culture and religion. These factors play a big role in maintaining the religious beliefs of an individual. Some young people, due to the long hair, sometimes making them look like females, are forced to cut it due to the "social image" of the individual. Other things such as being forced to drink alcohol or smoke, can go against the beliefs of not harming an individuals health. Moreover, Western countries have caused people to change themselves and move away from religious and cultural traditions to try and maintain a great image. Westernization doesn't necessarily have to happen in India. It can be caused when people migrate away from their home which makes them prone to forgetting the cultural and religious background, hence, increasing the process of westernization to take place.
