			The Punjabi Culture
		</h1>

		<p>
			The Punjabi Culture is a very diverse culture. There are many unique things about the Punjabi culture; from the food to the various festivals. The Punjabi culture originates in India and has many people in it. The people of the Punjabi culture are unique in the clothes they wear, the food they eat, and the festivals they celebrate. The clothes of the Punjabi people involve some sort of Indian embroidery together with a long top and some sort of pants. The women have a scarf and either wrap it around their head or just place it on the shoulder. The food of the Punjabi culture involves many different spices found in India. The signature dish is called "Makki di roti" and "Sarson da saag". This dish involves some sort of pancakes made out of corn and some spinach. Many people eat this dish during the various festivals because of the fact it is very tasty! The festivals in the Punjabi culture are also unique. For instance, there is a festival called "Lohri" which celebrates the start of a new harvest season. Punjab has a large population of farmers and therefore, it is essential to celebrate the progress of the farmers. Lohri involves people lighting a huge cone of wood on fire then dancing and celebrating next to it. The fire symbolizes the end of the past and the beginning of a new harvest season. This festival is on the thirteenth of January. People also come together and play musical instruments such as the "Dhol". This is some sort of two-sided drum played by two stick and produces a sound that can be danced to. The Punjabi culture is a jolly, unique and bright culture.
